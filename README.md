The FizzBuzz game/puzzle as a JavaScript Object

Note: This was originally a satirical blog entry based loosely upon The Oatmeal's "How A Web Design Goes Straight To Hell", except with a JavaScript solution for the whole FizzBuzz job interview question. Later on, I needed a JavaScript repo I could use as a proverbial crash test dummy, and this seemed perfect for the task.
